The slides and videos for my FOSDEM 2017 talk (<i>QEMU: internal APIs and conflicting world views</i>)
are available online.

* Slides: [https://habkost.net/talks/fosdem-2017/](https://habkost.net/talks/fosdem-2017/)
* Video: [https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/iaas_qemintapi/](https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/iaas_qemintapi/)

The subject I tried to cover is large for a 40-minute talk, but I
think I managed to scratch its surface and give useful examples.

Many thanks for the FOSDEM team of volunteers for the wonderful
event.
